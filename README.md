# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to add multiple filters in Danaâ€™s html UFO file to help her better understand trends in UFO sightings. To do this we needed to learn and use Java script to help make the html site and then to change it to included multiple filters.

## Results
On the HTML site, the first thing you would see is the title with a pictured background, subtitle, and a body paragraph talking about UFOs. Below that you will see the data of all the UFO sightings, to the left of that you can see the 5 filters.

To use these filters, all you need to do is enter the proper data point that you are looking for in the appropriate filter and then click out. For instance, if you want to see UFO sightings in California, you can go to the state filter and type ca then click anywhere else and you will see the data filtered. You can also combine different filters so putting ca in the state filter you can go to the date filter to see all of sighting in California from the date that you choose, by putting the date you want in the date filter and then clicking anywhere else. For the example below we chose the date 1/11/2010.

## Summary
This HTML page would help Dana for what she needs but it could be better. One of the draw backs to this HTML page is that all the data comes from the data.js file, so it would not be any live data just what she has on that file, maybe we could web scrape from other websites to get more data to help her out, and while we are talking about the data, we could maybe fix the data type for the length because right now it is hard to filter as some points say 1 min and others says half an hour and not 30 mins. I would also recommend to make it so that we can add multiple filters on one data type, for example if you want to check more than one state or to filter for more than one date because right now you can only for one data type at a time. Lastly, I would also recommend a small calendar button beside the date filter to help choose the date as some people use MM/DD/YYYY and others use DD/MM/YYYY but with the calendar they can choose the right day by click on the day that they want.
